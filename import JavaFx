    Download JavaFX SDK:
    Ensure that you have downloaded the correct version of the JavaFX SDK that matches your JDK version.
        Go to Gluon and download the appropriate SDK.

    Project Structure Configuration:
        Go to File > Project Structure.
        In Project settings, ensure the Project SDK is set to your JDK (make sure itâ€™s compatible with JavaFX).
        In Modules settings, select your module, then go to the Dependencies tab, and add the JavaFX libraries:
            Click on + > JARs or directories.
            Navigate to the lib folder inside your downloaded JavaFX SDK and add all JAR files.

    VM Options Configuration:

    To run a JavaFX application, you need to add VM options to specify the JavaFX modules to be included. Follow these steps:
        Go to Run > Edit Configurations.
        Select your application's run configuration in the application add through modify options "Add VM options".
        In the VM options field, add the following:

        --module-path "D:\IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.6\ProjectLibary\javafx-sdk-22.0.1\lib"
        --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Make sure the path matches the location where you have the JavaFX SDK installed.
